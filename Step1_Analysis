A local animal shelter is looking for an inexpensive automatic pet feeder that is able to dispense food to pets at preset times, monitor food consumption, and trigger an alert to staff if a problem occurs. The shelter plans to eventually build the system using affordable components such as a servo motor and basic sensors. 

The inputs for the system include feeding times, types of pet, food consumption sensor. The outputs of the system are timely food dispensing, alerts, and recording or displaying consumption data. The possible assumptions or limitations would be running out of food, staff miss the notification, only one type of pet food is used for both dogs and cats.


**Simple sketch of the system:** 

Start → Input Real Time 

IF Current time != feeding time ( 8 AM or 6 PM)→ display “not feeding time”, continue loop

ELSE identify pet profile ( type of pet, size) 

Calculate amount of required food

Check if food is sufficient or not ?

No: trigger alert “ low food supply” → end

Yes: continue activate dispenser motor 

Dispend to correct bowl

Check if dispensing was successful

No: trigger alert → end

Yes: continue

Read weight sensor → Wait 15 mins → compare initial weight with final weight 

IF initial = final → alert → end

IF initial > final → collect data → display → end
